Twenty-plus years into online distribution, and thirty-plus years since the first digital
products first became available commercially, the academic publishing industry is
undergoing a massive adaptation process. At first glance, academic publishing should
have shared the traits of most Business to Business (B2B) media businesses after
the transition to digital products and services: concentrated supply (protected by
scale economies in sales and distribution and high barriers to entry), strong pricing
power (driven by oligopolistic supply and by inelastic demand), and rising profitability.
While the industry has indeed experienced these trends, fault lines are appearing
everywhere, forcing the publishers to pursue different strategies from the past, which
have massive – and potentially negative – implications for the academic community.

These fault lines are driven by media usage behavior which is familiar to consumers.
Very much like cable TV viewers “cutting the cord” on their subscriptions, college
students are lowering their spending on textbooks by renting them or purchasing
them from the second-hand market; librarians, for their part, are taking tougher
stances when they negotiate the renewal of scholarly journal collections and are more
willing to let subscriptions expire. At the same time, digital dissemination has enabled
piracy to play an increasing role, in the form of gray market imports and counterfeit
physical textbooks, as well as unlicensed downloads of digital copies.

The response of the publishing industry has been predictable. On one hand, it has
put some effort into protecting its copyrights through legal action; on the other
hand, it has quietly started to lower prices (or the rate of price increases) to reflect
the changing elasticity of demand. Many publishers have started to also adapt to
new business models, in the hope that the industry can settle into a new equilibrium by embracing the equivalent of cable TV’s “skinny bundles” or the music industry’s
streaming subscriptions. As a result, hybrid scholarly journals, which maintain their
subscription model but accept Open Access (OA) publication fees (APCs), have taken
a substantial share of APC spending, and textbook publishers are pushing a model
they call “inclusive access” in the hope of recapturing student spending lost to the
secondary market. Some publishers, however, understand that all these are actions
are – essentially – palliative remedies.

Elsevier, Pearson and Cengage in particular are transforming themselves into data
analytics companies built atop their content, effectively adding ways to monetize it.
None of these companies shows any inclination to abandon its traditional content
business, and for sound reasons. These businesses are very large relative to the
overall size of either company, and failure to sustain their profitability would have
severe consequences for their respective valuations. In addition, without content
these companies would have a much harder task building credible data offerings. As
a result, the traditional journal business of Elsevier and the higher education textbooks
of Pearson and Cengage are likely to stay for a long time in their respective portfolios.
But the management teams of these companies clearly view the future as driven by
adding the provision of data and data analytics services to their respective customers,
rather than by growing only the traditional core business.

By leading the shift of the publishing industry into supplying data services, however,
Elsevier, Pearson and Cengage (as well as other entrants, coming both from the
publishing industry and from the information industry) are posing challenges for
the academic community. Until now, these companies were – at worst – seen by
institutions as an annoyance for selected communities within academia. Librarians
complained about the cost of periodicals and talked about a “serials crisis”, but the
impact on the overall budget of a university was well below half of a percentage
point. Similarly, the high cost of textbooks was an issue for students, and in particular
those coming from disadvantaged backgrounds, but scholarships and some forms of
financial aid, as well as the used textbook market, tended to mitigate the problem.

The move by publishers into the core research and teaching missions of colleges and
universities, with tools aimed at evaluating productivity and performance, means that
the academic community could lose control over vast areas of its core activities. In
addition, the collection of massive amounts of data about faculty and students poses a significant legal and reputational risk for institutions, along with potential privacy
and security threats for individuals.

It is important to underscore upfront that we are not opposing the use of data
and data analytics in academic institutions. This project is aimed at ensuring that
academic institutions retain control over the use of data and data analytics, that
the use of data and data analytic tools is consistent with the goals of the academic
community and that academic institutions are properly equipped to deal with the risks
and implications posed by the rising amount of data being collected, analyzed, and
used.
