In this tutorial i wil show you how to make a cool hover effect. it gives a cool effect to your website and is not that difficult to make.
When you kwon the basics of css you can make reale cool this with it.
you can also do it with img, then you can for example give them borders, or have them changed to another img.
I showed you in an earlier tutorial how to change the color you can now do that in the same way.
This is how to do it. 

{% highlight html %}
<html>
  <head>
    <style>
      p.tutorial {
      color: green;
      }
      
      p.tutorial:hover {
      color: blue;
      }
      </style>
    </head>
  <body> 
  <p class="tutorial">HOVER ME!!!</p>
  </body>
  </html>    
{% endhighlight %}

And this is the end result.
<html>
  <head>
    <style>
      p.tutorial {
      color: green;
      }
      
      p.tutorial:hover {
      color: blue;
      }
      </style>
    </head>
  <body> 
  <p class="tutorial">HOVER ME!!!</p>
  </body>
  </html>
  
I hope you did it and learned something from it.
