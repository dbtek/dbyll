>Who is your role model?

That's a difficult question and it's one I'm not sure I really have an answer to. Maybe the problem is the question. I think I dislike the term "role model" because it sounds too much like I would be taking a single individual as a template to completely emulate.

I believe more in being my own person, incorporating inspiration from around me to grow and become a better version of me. So a better question might have been "Who inspires you?"

Well, here's a list of people who come to mind at this point in time. So here goes, in no particular order:

* **Elon Musk**: Probably best known for SpaceX and Tesla Motors. I admire his position on climate change and his vision for the future. He is also a proponent of solar power, and with that in mind I think electric cars are a step in the right direction for reducing our reliance on non-renewal fossil fuels. Maybe we won't have solar-powered cars but at least the power for cars can come from renewal sources.
   
* **Edward Snowden**: Showing that there is a difference between what is lawful and what is just. While the authorities may deem his actions unlawful, I'm not alone in believing that he did the right thing and only did what had to be done. Here's a YouTube video explaining why digital rights are important, why [digital rights are human rights][GeorgeTorwell]. I don't know if I could/would have done what Snowden did if I were in his position but I don't think he was wrong to do it. Bonus mention for **John Oliver** a la *Last Week Tonight*, for that amazing interview with Edward Snowden and in general for bringing important issues to everyone's attention.

* **Zoë Quinn**: Indie game developer who I feel has been unfairly criticised on more than one occasion. I came across her via her game [Depression Quest][DepressionQuest], which I thought was very good and had a lot of truth in it considering it was a short IF (interactive fiction) type of game. Some people criticised it for not really being a game but I felt they were going by a narrow definition of what a game is. I'm reminded it's not high-tech that makes a game. Her [site][ZoeQuinnSite] is one of my first ports of call whenever I'm thinking about making a game - not making anything at the moment but I like to plan ahead.

* **Lepht Anonym**: I agree that technology should benefit as many people possible and not just the wealthy or some small group of people who happen to have special access. I believe transhumanism is a worthwhile endeavour but [Lepht Anonym][LephtSite] has gone further. They are a biohacker who has self-experimented with DIY implants, such as RFID chips and magnets. *Cool fact: Zoë Quinn has done the magnets and RFID too.* The concept of a technologically enabled sixth-sense is very interesting.
  
  If you the reader wish to try this sort of thing, I will wish you luck but know that I'm not responsible for anything that happens and that you do so entirely at your own risk!

  I'm not squeamish. Really, the sight of blood doesn't bother me. When I have blood drawn, I just calmly observe with a sort of passive fascination. I can watch surgical operations without any problem. I guess what's stopping me from from following the trail that individuals like Lepht and Zoë Quinn have blazed is a possibly unhelpful aversion to self-harm. OK, I'm a wuss when it comes to cutting into myself without any medical training. I really look forward to when these kinds of little upgrades become accepted and mainstream so I could just walk into a clinic and have it done.

As alluded to above, my inspiration comes from a wide range of sources so that list is far from exhaustive. Having written up this list, I think understand why asking about role models (or heroes, or inspirations) is such a popular question. I suppose it says something about me and what I believe in.
