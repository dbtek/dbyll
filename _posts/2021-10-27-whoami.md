Hey You! 👋

Welcome to another Azure-blog. ☁️

Short introduction:

- I work as a techincal specialist at Advania - Knownledge Factory. 🧐

- The best days starts with Azure, Bicep or PowerShell. 🦾

- In my free time I play discgolf, but you won't find me on the DGPT any time soon. 🥏

- I buy at least one pair of running shoes every month, even tough I hate running. 👠

The purpose of this blog is to learn and share anything I find intresting or hard to explain.
