As the project unfolded, we recognized the need for a range of potential solutions for the key stakeholders to [consider pursuing](https://josephmcarthur.github.io/infrastructure/template). *The purpose of this document is to build on the Landscape Analysis by offering a roadmap of potential actions that stakeholders can use to chart both individual and collective responses*. **Recognizing that solutions to these complex issues are not “one size fits all,” this document offers a framework with multiple, concrete solutions that individual organizations can improve and adapt to their local culture and needs**. What about if this needs a footnote, how does that look?[^1]
